      <p>Take a look around at the features I have up! I have some little gadgets that can be useful in some cases, though the most useful one is probably the color editor. I also have a couple of games on here that I've made.</p>
      <p>If for some inexplicable reason your computer doesn't run JavaScript (or ECMAScript, if you wish to be fancy) then there really isn't anything interesting for you here. The entire purpose of this place is to post things I make to practice my JavaScript skills.</p>
